## miniCalOPe

miniCalOPe is a basic OPDS (and HTML) catalog provider for eBooks.
It allows you to present your collection of eBooks (ePub & Mobi)
on the net (LAN and/or WAN) in order for eBook readers to directly connect and
download books, and also to allow people to access it with their web browsers
to walk through it.

### Requirements
miniCalOPe requires a web server powered by PHP 5.4+ with SQLite3 to present its
data. For data collection and preparation, you will need the PHP CLI (again with
SQLite3 support). If you want to integrate Amazon ads, *miniCalOPe* supports that
via the [Amazon Simple Api for PHP](https://github.com/IzzySoft/Asap), which then
must be installed in your PHP `include_path`.


### Limitations
No warranties at all :) For more, see also the other documentation files and man
pages. If you think there's something missing here, don't hesitate to notify the
author (me) about it - chances are quite good it will be added if possible. A
good way to do this is to open an issue at the [Github Project
Page](https://github.com/IzzySoft/miniCalOPe).
