History for miniCalOPe
======================

v1.9.0 (27.10.2013)
-------------------
+ added optional Amazon ads (decent!) to book details page
+ added search in comments (book descriptions)
* when $booksearchservices are disabled (empty array), suppress the entire booksearch-line on HTML book page
! in global booklist and search results, language was hardcoded ("book von author")
+ adding support for Flattr (see http://flattr.com/)
* XML/OPDS requires tags in XHTML content divs to be all lower-case. Taking care for that now.
! some terms in tpl/opds/index.tpl have been hardcoded instead of using placeholders for translated terms (Mateusz)
! epub files with an apostroph in filename are generating warnings during scan (scan.php; Mateusz)
* permitting more characters in searches, making them wildcards

v1.8.0 (16.02.2013)
-------------------
! SCAN: Merge crashed when started with empty DB
! fix some logic in merging series
* make alphabetical ordering default for tags
* added viewport-meta to all (HTML) pages, so they should be readable on mobile devices
  without zooming now
* have authors ordered by name per default
! fixed mime of book download links in OPDS
+ added FB2 to formats list
* replacing "PHP short_tags" with "full tags"
* several updates to the db classes (a.o. to make it work with PHP5/SQLite3 again without additional modules)

v1.7.0 (24.03.2012)
-------------------
! last change of get_filenames() broke eBook download when book file was replaced but
  database not (yet) updated, as Content-Length (from database) did no longer match.
  To prevent this (admittedly rare cases), for Content-Length we revert to filesize()
! if multiple books had the same filename, scan only got the last one
+ SCAN: placing inserts into transactions (speedup inserts by factor 20!)
+ SCAN: added 'merge' mode (still experimental). Using this the scan process tries
  to figure out what has changed, and merge in these changes - as opposed to the
  'rebuild' (as used up to now) which simply drops all information and builds all
  up from the scratch

v1.6.3 (19.12.2011)
-------------------
! the alternate "title" (from *.data) broke the download, as title was used to check the filename
! last change of get_filenames() broke eBook download (extension was lost)
* in places where lists could be ordered by date/time, inverted the order to show newest entries first

v1.6.0 (08.12.2011)
-------------------
+ Support for Amazon Partner-ID in ISBN-Links
+ added check for unencoded '&' in HREFs (when check_xml enabled)
+ optionally generating fake covers if no cover image available (HTML only)
+ added "title" attribute to *.data files to specify books title (if differing from file name)
+ added title search links to HTML view (to search for the selected book by author + title)
+ added check (and "auto-repair") for unescaped & in descriptions (to prevent trouble with XML)

v1.5.0
-------------------
+ make it easy to add more book formats (definitions kept in lib/formats.csv)
! if client transmitted "lang=" (w/o specifying any lang), book download sent a different book than requested
! PDF was using wrong mimetype on download
! download did not consider the "name" url parameter
* WillaMovius has closed (Amazon.DE ISBN Search), so we had to replace it

v1.4.0 (06.05.2011)
-------------------
* some better input handling for DB storage (escaping etc.)
! book details page was broken for OPDS
* scan no longer aborts when a book title failed (just logs the error and skips the book)
+ added simple XML check for description files
- removed $debug variable from sample configs (no longer used)

v1.3.0 (06.03.2011)
-------------------
! search template was not committed to repository
! pagination was broken in title list and search results
* wildcards ("*") in search terms truncated the whole term being treated as "vulnerable"
+ added ISBN-links to HTML version
+ more logging details on scan + webif
+ offering search-plugin to Firefox (so search can be triggered from its search bar)
