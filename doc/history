History for miniCalOPe
======================

v1.7.0
-------------------
! last change of get_filenames() broke eBook download when book file was replaced but
  database not (yet) updated, as Content-Length (from database) did no longer match.
  To prevent this (admittedly rare cases), for Content-Length we revert to filesize()
! if multiple books had the same filename, scan only got the last one
+ SCAN: placing inserts into transactions (speedup inserts by factor 20!)

v1.6.3 (19.12.2011)
-------------------
! the alternate "title" (from *.data) broke the download, as title was used to check the filename
! last change of get_filenames() broke eBook download (extension was lost)
* in places where lists could be ordered by date/time, inverted the order to show newest entries first

+ added "title" attribute to *.data files to specify books title (if differing from file name)
+ added title search links to HTML view (to search for the selected book by author + title)
+ added check (and "auto-repair") for unescaped & in descriptions (to prevent trouble with XML)

v1.5.0
-------------------
+ make it easy to add more book formats (definitions kept in lib/formats.csv)
! if client transmitted "lang=" (w/o specifying any lang), book download sent a different book than requested

! download did not consider the "name" url parameter
* WillaMovius has closed (Amazon.DE ISBN Search), so we had to replace it

v1.4.0 (06.05.2011)
-------------------
