Specifying MetaData
===================

For each book you can specify some additional MetaData placed in a file named
<bookname>.data (which must reside within the same directory as the book file
itself). Each line of this file specifies exactly one datum in the format

name::value

The following "names" are recognized and used:

series          collection a book belongs to (if there are multiple volumes)
series_index    which volume in above collection is this book
isbn            ISBN number for this book (may refer to the printed edition)

                are possible.
