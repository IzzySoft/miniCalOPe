1) Copyright and Warranty
-------------------------

This little program is (c)opyrighted by Andreas Itzchak Rehberg
(devel AT izzysoft DOT de) and protected by the GNU Public License Version 2
(GPL). For details on the License see the file LICENSE in this directory. The

===============================================================================

2) Requirements
---------------

miniCalOPe requires a web server powered by PHP 5.3+ with SQLite3 to present its data.
For data collection and preparation, you will either need Calibre, or the PHP
CLI (again with SQLite3 support).

===============================================================================

3) Limitations
---------------

No warranties at all :) For more, see also the other documentation files and man
pages. If you think there's something missing here, don't hesitate to notify the
author (me) about it - chances are quite good it will be added if possible.

===============================================================================

4) What is miniCalOPe, and what does it do?
-------------------------------------------

The short description above already said it: It's a basic OPDS catalog provider.

More detailed: It allows you to present your collection of eBooks (ePub & Mobi)
on the net (LAN and/or WAN) in order for eBook readers to directly connect and
download books, and also to allow people to access it with their web browsers
to walk through it.

As backend, you can either use Calibre (and have a graphical interface available
to manage your collection), or simply organize your books in a file structure.

===============================================================================

5) Installation and configuration
---------------------------------

See install_de.txt in this directory for German short instructions.
Alternatively, visit the project wiki for the same in either German or English,
including more details -- URL below.

===============================================================================

6) Usage
--------

Again: Please see the project wiki on this topic.
